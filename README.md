ConvNets i built . Most of them are the main building blocks. Great project to learn about different types of arhictectures


Maybe i will add different things here like other stuff mostly related to CNNs 
In the repo about the RNNs i will use it for the stuff related to transformers
There will be a repo about LLM Research ( its private right now, i am building it and it takes some time :)) )
